# üéüÔ∏è Welcome to Secure Ticketing Platform

In a world where privacy matters more than ever, ensuring seamless access to private tech hubs should not compromise user security. Enter the **Secure Ticketing Platform**, where cutting-edge privacy technology meets modern security needs.

Imagine walking into a tech hub, your identity protected, yet verified instantly by the guards. No cumbersome IDs. No compromising personal information. Just a simple, privacy-preserving ticket‚Äîthanks to **Privado ID**.

With **Privado ID** handling the behind-the-scenes magic, users can log in with abstracted authentication, ensuring their personal data is always secure. After authentication, a unique, scannable ticket is sent to their email, which acts as their entry pass.

Our solution protects the privacy of tech enthusiasts while providing a frictionless, secure experience at entry points.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14+)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed
- Privado ID Developer API Key

### Installation:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/secure-ticketing-platform.git
   cd secure-ticketing-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following keys:

   ```bash
   PRIVADO_CLIENT_ID=your_privado_client_id
   PRIVADO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_privado_client_secret
   EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The platform will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

1. **User Login**:

   - Users log in using **Privado ID**, where their credentials are abstracted, protecting their sensitive information.
   - A **JWT token** is generated and securely stored on the client-side.

2. **Ticket Generation**:

   - Once authenticated, a unique ticket (QR code) is generated using the `qrcode` library.
   - The ticket contains an encrypted payload (userID, expiration date) and is sent via email to the user.

3. **Ticket Verification**:
   - Upon arrival, the security guard scans the ticket.
   - The backend decrypts the payload, verifies the user's identity, and cross-checks the ticket with the database for validity and expiration.
